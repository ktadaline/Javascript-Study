/*Comparison Operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between
variables or values. They return true or false.

The equal to (==) operator checks whether the operands' values are equal */

/*
Operator    Description                  Example

==          equal to                     5 == 10 false
===         identical
            (equal and of same type)     5 === 10 false
!=          not equal to                 5 !=10 true
>           greater than                 10 > 5 true
>=          greater than or equal to     10 >= 5 true
<           less than                    10 < 5 false
<=          less than or equal to        10 <= 5 false


when using operators, be sure that the arguments are of the same data type; numbers should be
compared with numbers, strings with strings and so on..
