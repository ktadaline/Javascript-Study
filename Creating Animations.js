/*
Animations

Now that we know how to select and create DOM events, we can create a simple animation. Let's create a simple HTML page
with a box element that will be animated using JS.

To create an animation, we need to change the properties of an element at small intervals of time. We can achieve this
by using the setInterval()method, which allows us to create a timer and call a function to change properties repeatedly
at defined intervals (in milliseconds)
