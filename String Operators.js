/*
String Operators

The most useful operator for strings is the concatenation, represented by the + sign.
Concatenation can be used to build strings by joining together multiple strings, or by
joining strings with other types:
 */

var mystring1 = "I am learning ";
var mystring2 = "JavaScript.";
document.write(mystring1 + mystring2);
